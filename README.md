# ag2n_iso

Program to find affine equivalence classes in AG(2,n). Heavy WIP.

As an example of what this program can do, below is a graph of all affine equivalence classes of caps in AG(2,8). Each node is an affine equivalence class, each arrow indicates adding a vector, and the label X-YD represents a X-cap of dimension Y.
